					 target="_blank">C_TERP10_67</a>&nbsp;certification exam. &nbsp;The TERP10 certification is SAP's associate (entry level) certification
					for ERP. &nbsp;The training class for the certification is normally 9 days, 8 hours/day and the exam is on the 10th
					day. &nbsp;Thus the name:&nbsp;Training for&nbsp;ERP&nbsp;for&nbsp;10&nbsp;days. &nbsp;

				There are many certifications in the IT field, some more well regarded than others. The TERP10 is a very well regarded
						primarily because it is not easy to get. &nbsp;You can see from the size of the book that there is a lot of material.
						&nbsp;In addition, the exam is difficult. &nbsp;You are expected to know the material in detail to pass the exam. &nbsp;So
						there is good news and bad news. &nbsp;The bad news is that you will have to dedicate yourself to this course to pass
						the exam. &nbsp;Students who take the face-to-face training course describe the experience as very intense. &nbsp;I've
						witnessed very emotional responses when students submit their exam to be graded. &nbsp;The good news is that, as a
						direct result of this difficulty, the TERP10 certification has real value. &nbsp;Not only will you receive a solid
						foundation for a career working with ERP systems, employers who understand what the TERP10 is will value your accomplishment.
						&nbsp;In my opinion, this class is unlike typical university courses and passing the certification is a more difficulty
						accomplishment than getting an A in a typical course.

			<h3>
				Exam Format
			</h3>
			<p>The exam consists of 80 multiple choice questions over 3 hours. Many of the questions are difficult and may require multiple
				answers. You are told how may answers are required but the grading is all-or-nothing. You cannot get partial credit.
				This means you must go beyond general familiarity with the material.&nbsp; You have to really know it.&nbsp; The passing
				grade is 59% the last time we taught the course but it may change. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Preparing for the Exam</h3>
				<p>Don't be fooled by the low passing grade, the exam is very difficult and the pass rate is relatively low. In order to pass, you must commit yourself to preparing for the exam over the next two weeks. In our experience, if you have a part-time job or any other outside commitments, you will find it very difficult to pass. You should study at least 3 hours each day after class. The following guidelines might help:
				<ul>
					<li>Use multiple modes of study (read the book, use the diagrams, read SAP Help, quiz yourself and your classmates, do the hands-on exercises, etc.).</li>
					<li>It's very beneficial to study in groups and quiz each other.</li>
					<li>When you do the hands-on exercises, keep the process diagram handy and try to link each step to the conceptual material. This gives you a visual anchor.</li>
					<li>Study every day. The material comes at you fast and there is new material everyday do don't think you can take it easy at the beginning.</li>
					<li>Quiz yourself and quiz your class mates.  It's the only way to know whether you really know the material.</li>
					<li>Take advantage of the weekend to catch up and solidify what you covered the previous week.  How well you do often depends on how well you use the weekend.</li>
